We are excited to introduce a Gradio-based web application that utilizes the powerful Vintern-1B-v3.5 model to extract key information from images. This project allows users to upload an image and receive structured markdown output containing extracted details.
This solution is designed to run entirely on CPU, making it accessible to a wider range of users without requiring a high-end GPU. 

**ðŸ“Œ Features**

**Easy Image Upload:** Users can upload any image via the Gradio interface.

**Automatic Information Extraction:** The model processes the image and returns the key insights in markdown format.

**Lightweight Deployment:** The app runs efficiently on CPUs, making it suitable for cloud deployment and personal use. ðŸ›  Installation & Setup
